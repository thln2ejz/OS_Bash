Generate random web traffic (for obfuscating real traffic)

Usage:  ./traffic_gen.sh

ARGS:
        None: N/A

OUTPUT:

        None: extracted html files will be stored in /tmp/random_traffic

DESCRIPTION:

Generate random web traffic by querying the DuckDuckGo search engine with phrases
of random length (2-6 words) constructed by picking words randomly from a
built-in dictionary (/usr/share/dic/words). Fetching is done minimally with wget, 
and the user-agent is set apriori. The interval between successive downloads is set to be
random (between 30 and 90 seconds). The script can be run in the background during a
web browsing session and can help obfuscate real traffic. Note that the use of wget 
in the script can be extended to pursue links within each page recursively to a specified depth.
! Make sure to kill the script once done with browsing.
